## Responsible Data Science

When we use data science to solve a problem you care about, we have a responsibility to develop solutions that safeguard and promote the wellbeing of your audience. My framework for responsible data science helps you use data science responsibly and ethically.





  When we use data science to solve a problem you care about, we have a responsibility to you, your audience, and the people your data comes from to do good.

When we use data science to solve a problem you care about, we have a responsibility to the people affected by your problem to use their data for good and protect them from unintended consequences.
