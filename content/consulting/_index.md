    If you have a problem that you want to use data science to answer, I have
    the skills and experience to help you. I offer several consulting services
    to help you solve the problems you care about at any point in your project
    lifecycle, including long and short term consulting work, private training,
    and drop-in consulting. I value building new connections and would love to
    discuss opportunities to work with you. Let's get to know each other.
