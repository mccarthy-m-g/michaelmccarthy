## A Recipe for Success

When we want to use data to solve a problem you care about, our first step is to define your problem. Our second step is to determine the people affected by your problem, and what a meaningful solution looks like to them. Only then do we think about how data science can help.

This recipe allows us to approach your problem with intent---once we know what the problem you care about is and what a meaningful solution looks like to the people affected by it, we can work backward to figure out the data, analyses, and tools needed to solve your problem. By framing your data problem this way, we can use data science to develop a solution that matters to you and your audience.
