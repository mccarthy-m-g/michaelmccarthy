## Ingredients for Data Science

We can develop meaningful solutions for the problems you care about by using data science to turn data into knowledge, insight, and understanding. A typical data science project involves a variety of technical and interpersonal skills and looks something like this:

1. Define your problem and the people affected by it
2. Determine potential meaningful solutions to your problem
3. Identify data sources and gather your data 
4. Tidy and prepare your data
5. Explore and analyze your data
6. Communicate your data story to decision makers and stakeholders

Surrounding each of these processes are technical skills such as programming and statistics, and interpersonal skills such as relationship building and storytelling.
