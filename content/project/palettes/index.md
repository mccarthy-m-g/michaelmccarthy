palettes is an R package for working with colour vectors and colour
palettes. There are three main goals to the palettes package, each
described in a vignette:

-   To provide a new family of colour classes (`palettes_colour` and
    `palettes_palette`) that always print as hex codes with colour
    previews; `vignette("palettes")`.

-   To provide a comprehensive library of methods for working with
    colour vectors and colour palettes, including methods for ggplot2,
    `vignette("ggplot2")`; gt, `vignette("gt")`; biscale,
    `vignette("biscale")`; and other colour packages,
    `vignette("compatibility")`.

-   To make it easy for anyone to make their own colour palette package;
    `vignette("creating-packages")`. Colour palette packages made with
    palettes exist solely for the purpose of distributing colour
    palettes and get access to all the features of palettes for free.

## Installation
