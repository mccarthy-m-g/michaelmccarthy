Tidy Tales is a data science blog meant to demonstrate the skills needed in a typical data science project. Namely, wrangling, visualizing, modelling, and communicating data, all with the assistance of programming. The blog takes its name from the [tidy data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10) framework for structuring data, and from its narrative style. My inspiration for the blog came from [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), a weekly data project for practicing and building data science skills with real-world data. Many, but not all, of the posts on Tidy Tales will use data from Tidy Tuesday.
