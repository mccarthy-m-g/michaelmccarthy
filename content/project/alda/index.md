The **alda** package contains 31 data sets provided by Singer and Willet (2003) with their book, *Applied longitudinal data analysis: Modeling change and event occurrence*, that are suitable for longitudinal mixed effects modelling, longitudinal structural equation modelling, and survival analysis. All the data sets in this package are real data from real studies; however, most were modified by Singer and Willet (2003) for the illustration of statistical methods, so they may not match the results of the original studies.

The [package website](https://mccarthy-m-g.github.io/alda/) contains 14 articles demonstrating how to recreate examples from the textbook in R, and 1 vignette with tips and tricks for working with longitudinal data.
