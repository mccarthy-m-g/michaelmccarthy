TODO: Decide on the layout for CV items using Tachyons CSS. Once this is
decided then I can create R functions that take a data frame of CV items
as input, and output the correct HTML/CSS code for each item upon knitting.
This is what the {vitae} package does, except it is mainly for PDF output and
doesn't play nice with blogdown. I should use the htmltools package for my
own functions.
