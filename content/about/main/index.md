  I am an award winning data scientist and R programmer passionate about solving problems with data. My background is in psychology research, where I’ve studied topics ranging from attitude formation, to decision-making, to individual differences in brain function. Studying how people think and act has given me a deep appreciation for the human side of data science. Much of our data is about people. All of our data is communicated to people. Understanding these relationships has been key to successfully navigating my role as a data scientist.

  If you have a problem that you want to use data science to answer, I would love to help you. I offer several [consulting services](/consulting/) to help you accomplish your goals at any point in your project lifecycle, including long and short term consulting work, private training, and drop-in consulting. I value building new connections and would love to [discuss](/contact/) opportunities to work with you. Let's get to know each other.

  When I’m not working you can find me writing music in my studio, riding my bike on the local trails, or spending time with my friends and family.
