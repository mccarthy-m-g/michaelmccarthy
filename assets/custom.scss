// Override this file to add your own SCSS styling.

// Temporary fix for .about-sidebar because it can't be completely overwritten
// apparently. The `about/list.html` layout can be deleted after my PR is
// merged. It is only needed right now to call `.aboutme-sidebar` instead of
// `.about-sidebar`.
.aboutme-sidebar {
  @extend .self-start, .sticky, .bg-#{$sidebarBgColor}, .#{$sidebarTextColor};
